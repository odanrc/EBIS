# EBIS - Eye Based Independance System

EBIS is a system to allow people with physical disabilities use computers. It emulates mouse and keyboard commands with facial gestures, such as blinking and eye movement. It is based on the article "Monocular Gaze Tracking System for Disabled People Assistance". If you use this system, please cite  (TODO cite).

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Currently, only Linux is supported. The system uses OpenCV for the algorithms, and SDL 2.0 and X11 for command generation.

## HOW TO USE

Create an instance of the system and call update(cv::Mat image). The system will automatically detect faces and calculate gaze direction. Whenever a user closes both eyes, the system will change mode. Check src/exe/main.cc for an example, and the section **Modes** for command interpretation and mode description.

There's also a Pong game implemented, which can be played with the eyes by calling playPong(cv::Mat image).

## MODES

## TODO

The system still lacks a lot of functionality, as it does not fully allow human-computer interaction yet. Besides that, the algorithms used within the gaze detector should always be improved, in order to achieve maximum robustness.

- Improve blink detection. One small and simple option is to train a Haar Classifier for closed eyes.
- Create a calibration step to calculate user screen distance. It's suggested to create a dot on the screen and require the user to look at it. The system should estimate various screen distances, and the one that leads to a focal point that is the closest to the dot should be the base screen distance.
- Hack XSendEvent, or use another way to emulate clicks, as it is not accepted by all softwares.
- Use Kalman Filters to better estimate pupil position and gaze direction.
- Add Tipying mode. Good results can be achieved by using something similiar to Ward's Dasher.
- Add Right Click mode. Can be a Left Click Mode followed by a screen with the options generated by the right click.
- Add Drag mode. Can be 2 Left Click Modes in a row, such that the first click is the src, and last click is dst.
- Add Alt+Tab Mode.
- Improve desktop screenshot acquisition
- Create and Test Windows Version.
